This simple Java program takes a user-input number and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts integer input from the user
- Displays a neatly formatted multiplication table
- Uses `Scanner` class for input and a `for` loop for generating the table

## 🧾 Example Output

```
